# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a user-friendly application where users can search for current weather data by city name. The dashboard uses the OpenWeather API to provide data of the current day and also provides the 5-day weather forecast. Users will be able to see the temperature, humidity %, the wind speed miles per hour, and their city search history.
